VimLinkNotes - A Personal Wiki in Vim
Benoit Hamelin, 2011

WHAT IS IT?
===========

This is a set of small configuration files that allow the navigation and
editing of cross-referenced topics dispersed over a collection of
text files, using Vim and Exuberant ctags. Full information is available at

http://benoithamelin.tumblr.com/vimlinknotes/

INSTALLATION
============

Run the install.sh script with your own rights (e.g. without using sudo) to
deploy the configuration files for your own account. System-wide deployment is
not implemented at the moment.
